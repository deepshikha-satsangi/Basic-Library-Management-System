# Basic-Library-Management-System
This is a "Basic Library Management System Project" in "jupyter" written in Python programming language, Python is very smooth to research the syntax emphasizes readability and it is able to reduce time ingesting in developing.
The library management system in an application for assisting a librarian in managing books in library.A Library Management System Python is providing all the functionality related to library. It tracks all the information and details of the book present in the library.
Here I have created a main function and run an infinite while loop asking for their inputs.
Through this program (Library Management) we can find out a whole list of books present in the library , we can lend a book, add and return books.
Step1-Create a library class
In this I have defined
#display book
#lend book (if the book is present)
#add book
#return book.
Step2-Create Library
Here I have created a small library and I have used my name as library name.
Step3-Create Loops
Here I have created some infinite loops using while loop and if-else loop in which I have taken inputs for all the conditions(display book, lend book, add book, return book).And in the end I have printed the statement defined the choices as c and q.
